# Design and Development of a Mobile Application to Support Sustainable Agricultural Management with Pest Identification

## Project Overview:
This project aimed to design and develop an Android mobile application designed to help users efficiently manage their crops, with a key focus on pest identification to provide farmers with essential tools for crop protection. 

One of the main features of the app is a comprehensive crop encyclopaedia, where users can find information on symptoms, causes, prevention methods, and recommendations for various crop diseases. The app also includes a pest identification section, allowing users to select a specific field, upload photos, and receive solutions to prevent and control the pests identified in the uploaded images.Additionally, the app displays weather information for specific locations and provides a list of fields. Users can review detailed information about each field by clicking on the field's name, making it easier to monitor and manage their crops.

Through research, I compared various existing agricultural mobile applications to identify gaps in the market. This informed the development of the app, focusing on user-friendly functionality and essential features that are currently lacking in similar tools.

The mobile application was developed using Kotlin in Android Studio, with the user interface designed in Figma. Lucid Chart was utilized to create both the database diagrams and the flowcharts, ensuring a clear and organized structure. The project was completed over a 9-month period.

## The database already contains some data:
1. Information about Sam Field and Tom Field.
2. The crop encyclopedia includes details about apples.
3. The pests data covers information on ants, aphids, beetles, bollworms, caterpillars, fleas, flies, leaf miners, mites, snails, spiders, and slugs.

## Project Timeline

This project was originally completed between September 2022 and June 2023. However, due to the deletion of my previous email account, the project had to be migrated to my current email account. As a result, the dates on GitHub do not match the actual development period.
