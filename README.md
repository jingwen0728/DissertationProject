Design and Development of a Mobile Application to Support Sustainable Agricultural Management with Pest Identification

Project Overview:
This project aims to develop an Android mobile application designed to help users efficiently manage their crops. A key feature of the app is its ability to identify pests, providing farmers with the necessary tools to protect their crops.

Through research, I compared various existing agricultural mobile applications to identify gaps in the market. This informed the development of the app, focusing on user-friendly functionality and essential features that are currently lacking in similar tools.

The mobile application was developed using Kotlin in Android Studio, with the user interface designed in Figma. Lucid Chart was utilized to create both the database diagrams and the flowcharts, ensuring a clear and organized structure.

The database already contains some data:
1. Information about Sam Field and Tom Field.
2. The crop encyclopedia includes details about apples.
3. The pests data covers information on ants, aphids, beetles, bollworms, caterpillars, fleas, flies, leaf miners, mites, snails, spiders, and slugs.

How to Access the App:
You can log in to the application using the following credentials:
Email: tom@gmail.com
Password: password123Q

Troubleshooting:
If you encounter issues while running the code, here are some possible solutions:
1. In app/src/main/java/com/example/data/AppDatabase, increase the database version number by 1.
2. Change the file path of the keystore.
3. Add the following line to local.properties:
MAP_API_KEY=AIzaSyBYQj-HAcBc4c2HkuOHjwikID5zq9_veCo
